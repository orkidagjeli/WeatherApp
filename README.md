# WeatherApp
Developed a dynamic weather forecast web application that provides real-time weather updates based on user input. The project integrates a weather API to fetch accurate weather data, including temperature, and weather conditions for various locations. The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and responsive interface. AJAX is used to make asynchronous requests, ensuring smooth data retrieval without page reloads. PHP is implemented on the backend to handle API requests and manage server-side operations, enhancing performance and data security.
